# cs50x-go

Harvard's [cs50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) problem sets solved in golang and packaged into one tight package.

## setup

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/zane-schaffer/cs50-go.git
    cd cs50-go
    make
    ./cs50
```

`ls` for all programs available

Will be updating this as I solve more of the problems
